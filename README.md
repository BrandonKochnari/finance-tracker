- Practical tooling for real-world personal finance use cases

---

## Features

- Expense and income tracking
- Budget management
- Categorized transactions
- Spending insights and basic analytics

## Architecture

The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles:

- **Entities:** Core financial models (transactions, budgets, categories)
- **Use Cases:** Business logic for tracking and analysis
- **Interface Adapters:** Controllers, presenters, and data adapters
- **Frameworks & Drivers:** UI and external integrations

This structure keeps business logic independent of frameworks and UI concerns.
